Because everything always feels like it's *due* *too* soon...

### This is your personal checklist manager!
The **Too-Due List Manager** can maintain a group of independent events. It gives you the power to:
 - Add / Remove items
 - Set / Remove due dates
 - Modify existing data
 - Determine status of completion
 - View items by completion status
 - Delete entire lists
 - Import / Export lists
 - Sort by description *(alphabetically)* / due date *(chronologically)*

The following User Guide will help you understand how to use this program.

## Add new event

The todo list will load with no items present, so the first order of business is to populate it.

 1. Select the **[New Item]** Button
 2. Enter the event description in the **[Description]** text box.
 3. Click the **[Calendar]** and navigate to the desired due date.
 **Note:** This part is optional. Leave the box blank for an event with NO due date.
 4. Select the desired **[Completion Status]** button.
 5. Press the **[Add]** button to add the new event to the list.

## Edit event details

There might be a time where your description doesn't fit the actual event, or the date was pushed back due to complications. More commonly, you may have just completed an item early. To modify the details of an event:

 1. **[Click]** the desired event on the main table.
 **Note:** You will notice the values populated the controls on the bottom of the application. This is where you will modify the values.
 2. To change the *description*, enter the new description in the **[Description]** text box, and push **[Enter]** to confirm.
 3. To change the *due date*, click the **[Calendar]** and navigate to the new date. It will update the value automatically.
 4. To change the *completion status*, select the opposite **[Completion status]** button.

## Delete a due date

If the due date of an event is unspecified, it is acceptable to use a blank date. 
To delete a due date:
1. **[Click]** the desired event on the main table.
2. **[Click]** the text in the calendar box, and **delete** it.
3. Press **[Enter]**.
Now the due date should be set to **"N/A"**.

To create a new item without a due date: 
1. Follow steps _1._ and _2._ of **Add new event**.
2. Do **NOT** select a date in the calendar object.
3. Press the **[Add]** button to add the new event to the list.

Now you should have created a new event without a due date.


## Delete an event

Some events come and go, and it's nice to clear up some space on your list for new entries. To delete an event:

 1. **[Click]** the desired event on the main table.
 2. Select the **[Delete]** drop-down button, then select **[Item]**.

## Delete all events

It is also nice to be able to clear your entire palette of events. To delete all events from your list:

 1. Select the **[Delete]** drop-down button, then select **[All Items]**.

## Filter events by completion

It can be a hastle to filter through the completion status of all the events in a todo list. Luckily, you can change the view of the table to be either the completed or incompleted entries. To do so:

 1. Select the **[View]** menu button.
 2. To sort by *completed* events, select **[Complete]**.
 To sort by incompleted events, select **[Incomplete]**.

**Note:** You can restore the original view by selecting the **[All]** option.

## Sort events by description

To make the list look prettier, you can sort the entries alphabetically by their descriptions:

 1. Navigate to the **[Description]** column title in the table.
 2. Click it **[One]** time to sort by ascending values.
 Click it **[Two]** times to sort by descending values.
 Click it **[Three]** times to cancel the sort.

## Sort events by due date

It may also help to order the events chronologically, in case you need to visualize what is approaching the quickest:

 1. Navigate to the **[Due Date]** column title in the table.
 2. Click it **[One]** time to sort by chronological dates.
 Click it **[Two]** times to sort by reverse chronological dates.
 Click it **[Three]** times to cancel the sort.

## Save list to local storage

What would be a well-made application without the ability to save your work? To save your current list of events:

 1. Select the **[File]** menu button.
 2. Select **[Save List]**.
 3. Select the **[File Path]** button. 
 4. Navigate to the desired file directory on your computer and select **[Select Folder]**.
 5. Enter the desired file name in the **[File Name]** text box.
 6. Press **[Save]**.

**Note:** The file will be created as a _".txt"_ at the specified location.

## Load list from file

Similar to saving a list to local storage, you can import a previously-saved list into the application:

 1. Select the **[File]** menu button.
 2. Select **[Load List]**.
 3. Select the **[Choose File]** button. 
 4. Navigate to the desired _".txt"_ file on your computer and select **[Open]**.
